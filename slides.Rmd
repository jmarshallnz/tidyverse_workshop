# Getting started

Load up [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/).

Install the complete tidyverse with:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Grab the zip file for todays tutorial, unzip, and load up `tidyverse.Rmd`

http://shiny.massey.ac.nz/jcmarsha/tidyverse.zip

Run the first chunk to load the libraries/data.

```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
roll = readRDS('data/roll.rds')
schools = readRDS('data/schools.rds')
```

# The data
---

# roll

Number of school kids by school, gender, ethnic group and level in 2017.

Each row represents a school, gender, ethnic group and level.
```{r}
roll
```

---

# schools

Information on each school, including type, affiliation and region.
```{r}
schools
```

# The tidyverse

An **opinionated** collection of R packages designed for data science.

All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

# There is a **right way** to do things

Everything is a `data.frame`. 

--
All operations take a `data.frame` as their first argument and return a `data.frame`<sup>*</sup> as output.
  - This allows chaining operations together.
  - This makes things predictable - you **always** get a `data.frame`<sup>*</sup>.

--

All operations are **verbs** that don't have side effects.
  - They don't alter the environment, print or plot.
  - Naming things is hard.

--

Most of the time, this is what you want when processing data.

Sometimes you want something other than a `data.frame` (e.g. a `vector` or `number`). There's sometimes a separate verb for that.

.footnote[[*] Actually we use `tibble`'s as `data.frame`'s are not opinionated enough!]

# `%>%`

---
# The pipe

The **pipe** is an operator from the `magittr` package.

`df %>% func(a,b)`

is equivalent to

`func(df, a, b)`.

This makes it easy to couple functions together.

--
Instead of 

`h(g(f(df, a, b), c))` .huge[`r emo::ji("sob")`]

--

we have

`df %>% f(a,b) %>% g(c) %>% h()` .huge[`r emo::ji("grinning")`]

# dplyr
---
# dplyr

A grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

--

- `filter()` picks cases based on their values.
- `arrange()` changes the order of the rows.
- `select()` picks variables based on their names.
- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing variables.
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.

--

These then combine with `group_by()` to perform the above by group.

--

`dplyr` abstracts over how the data are stored.

 - It works with local data frames.
 - It works with remote database tables.
 - All using the same R code.

---

# filter

```{r}
roll %>% filter(EthnicGroup == "Māori", Gender == "Female")
```

---

# filter

```{r}
roll %>% filter(Level == "Year 1" | Level == "Year 2",
                Gender == "Male")
```

---

# arrange

```{r}
roll %>% arrange(Gender, EthnicGroup, Level)
```

```{r}

How many students were in year 13 at Awatapu College in 2017?

# group_by

`group_by` splits the data frame up into groups.

All other verbs then operate per-group.

clean %>% group_by(School) %>% head

# group_by

  group_by(School, Level) %>%
  summarise(Students = sum(Students))
```

```{r}
clean %>%
  filter(EthnicGroup == "Pasifika") %>%
  group_by(School, Gender) %>%

# tidyr

The goal is to create **tidy data**. Data where:

1. Each variable is a column.
2. Each observation is a row.
3. Each value is a cell.

--

Two key verbs:

 - `gather()` takes multiple columns and gathers them into key-value pairs. Makes wide data long.
 - `spread()` takes two columns (key, value) and spreads them over multiple column. Makes long data wide.

--

Other useful verbs:

 - `separate()` and `extract()` pulls apart a column that represents multiple variables (e.g. dates?)
 - `replace_na()` and `drop_na()` for control of missing values.

---
# gather

Gather is useful where we have observations spread across columns (often columns values). It takes wide data to long.
```{r}
wide = tibble(id = 1:4, week1 = rnorm(4),
              week2 = rnorm(4), week3 = rnorm(4))
wide
```

--
Here the `week` columns are the value that the variable `week` takes. And we have 3 observations for id 1 spread
across columns.

---

# gather

A tidy version would have three variables and 12 observations.

```{r}
wide %>% gather(week, value, week1:week3)
```

---

# gather

`readr::parse_number` is a handy function to pull numbers out of strings.
```{r}
long = wide %>% gather(week, value, week1:week3) %>%
  mutate(week = readr::parse_number(week))
long
```

---
# gather

Once gathered, we can easily compute summaries on groups:
```{r}
long %>% group_by(week) %>% summarise(mean=mean(value))
long %>% group_by(id) %>% summarise(lowest=min(value))
```
---

# spread

`spread()` does the opposite:
```{r}
long %>% spread(week, value)
```
---

# spread

Using numbers for columns can be a bit fiddly to work with.

```{r}
long %>% spread(week, value, sep='_')
```

A separator codes the columns as `<key_name><sep><key_value>`.

---

# spread

```{r}
clean %>%
  filter(EthnicGroup == "Pasifika") %>%
  group_by(School, Gender) %>%
  summarise(Students = sum(Students)) %>%
  spread(Gender, Students) %>%
  mutate(Total = Male + Female) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total))
```

# joins

---
# left_join

`left_join(x, y)` merges the data frames `x` and `y` on common (or specified) columns.
  - All columns from `x` and `y` are retained.
  - All rows from `x` are retained.
  - If multiple rows of `y` match `x`, all matches are returned (duplicating the `x` rows).
  - If no rows of `y` match, they'll be filled with `NA`.

--

There's 5 other joins:
 - `right_join`
 - `inner_join`
 - `full_join`
 - `semi_join`
 - `anti_join`

`left_join` is the one I use the most.
---
# left_join

```{r}
clean %>% group_by(School) %>%
  summarise(Students = sum(Students)) %>%
  left_join(schools, by='School') %>%
  select(School, Students, TerritorialAuthority)
